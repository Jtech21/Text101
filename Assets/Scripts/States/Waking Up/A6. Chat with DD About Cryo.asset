  _storyText: "Tech 27451: You know when I defrosted this morning I just felt extra
    worn by the experience.\r\n\r\nDD:[ That sounds unpleasant. May I ask you something
    Doctor?\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Shoot DD.\r\n\r\nDD:| Does Cryosleep feel similar
    to actual sleep? You seem to refer to them similarly but I understand them to
    be quite different.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Well yes and no. Cryo is definitely way
    more clinical and precise. You set the timer, step into the chamber and then
    it does all the rest. Sleep is a lot harder to make happen. At least for me it
    is.\r\n\r\nDD:| So you are an insomniac? I don't see that in your file.\r\n\r\nTech
    27451: No not that bad. I hear some people can just lay down in bed and be asleep
    within minutes but I'm easily distracted from it. It can sometimes take me hours.\r\n\r\nDD:]
    Humans have such interesting differences. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: On the other hand
    when I wake up from a nap I usually don't have to clear my lungs of a preservative
    fluid.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: At least when I'm not sick...\r\n\r\nDD:/ A vivid image.
