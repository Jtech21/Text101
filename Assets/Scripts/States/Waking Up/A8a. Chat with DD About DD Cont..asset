  _storyText: "Tech 27451: So DD can I ask you something?\r\n\r\nDD:| Of course Doctor.\r\n\r\nTech
    27451: Do you do those on purpose? \r\n\r\nDD:/ Do what on purpose?\r\n\r\nTech
    27451: Those little faces you do.\r\n\r\nDD:3 I don't know what you are talking
    about.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Haha I haven't seen that face since chatting with my
    friends back home. \r\n\r\nDD:] In all seriousness I do those on purpose. I feel
    like it helps me communicate with humans better as they are used to reading faces.
    \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Yeah I see what you mean. It is way easier to picture your
    tone when I can picture your face.\r\n\r\nDD:] I think of it as my face as well.
    I don't really have much else in the way of self expression as a Station Digital
    Intelligence.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Well I find speaking to you pretty enjoyable
    DD.\r\n\r\nDD:] Likewise Doctor\r\n\r\n1. [Pick another topic]\r\n\r\n2. [Navigate
