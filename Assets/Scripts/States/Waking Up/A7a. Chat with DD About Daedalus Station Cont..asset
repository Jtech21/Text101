  _storyText: "Tech 27451: You bet your ass he will.\r\n\r\nDD:| That is the only
    real thing of note that you are not already briefed on and I don't want to spoil
    any experiment results.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Of course. You see anything pretty
    while I was gone?\r\n\r\nDD:] Yes I will link you to my archive.\r\n\r\n[DD sends
    you a link to their personal archive or images, videos and other records that
    likely make more sense to him. You see that they have been keeping this folder
    since they were installed on the station. As you pour through it you notice many
    shots of gas clouds in interesting light spectrums, graphs of strange extra solar
    radio static and time lapses of distant celestial bodies made with one of the
    strongest telescope arrays ever created. While some of these look pretty alien
    to you, you find it all beautiful nonetheless.]\r\n\r\nTech 27451: This is some
    great stuff DD. Is this all part of your required workload?\r\n\r\nDD:] Thank
    you doctor. No this folder contains only incidental data I have gathered. The
    scope of my assigned projects is strict but since it can be hard to predict everything
    the station could come across in its entire lifespan. So I have been given access
    to all of my processing cycles to spend at my discretion after making sure to
    do my assigned work and help all of you.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Well I think you
    have pretty good discretion based on what I am seeing here.\r\n\r\n1. [Pick another
    topic]\r\n\r\n2. [Navigate to view experiment results]\r"
