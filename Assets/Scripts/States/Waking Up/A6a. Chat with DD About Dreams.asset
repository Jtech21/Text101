  _storyText: "DD:| Another question?\r\n\r\nTech 27451: You don't have to ask every
    time.\r\n\r\nDD: -Setting saved-\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Very funny.\r\n\r\nDD:| Do
    you dream in cryo sleep?\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Hmm... you know I'm not really sure.
    I don't really remember my dreams very often when I sleep normally actually.
    I've never thought about whether or not that was because it was possible though.
    Maybe I should start meditating or something to see if I can remember more dreams
    and let you know.\r\n\r\nDD:| I don't have dreams either. I haven't been shut
    off since I was installed into the Daedalus's systems. I do have to cycle sections
    of my memory and defragment drives sometimes. I suppose at those times I am running
    at a lower level of capacity which sounds something like the descriptions of
    sleep that I know. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Another thing we have in common I suppose.\r\n\r\nDD:]
    A nice way of putting it.\r\n\r\n1. [Pick another topic]\r\n\r\n2. [Navigate
    to view Experiment results]\r"
