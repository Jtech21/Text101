  m_Name: A7. Chat with DD About Daedalus Station
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  _storyText: "Tech 27451: So DD how has the station been doing in my absence?\r\n\r\nDD:]
    Quite well actually. Supply depletion is within expectations and between you
    going into cryo and now I have updated nearly all scientists on the progress
    of their experiments. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: No system failures or warnings I should
    know about?\r\n\r\nDD:] Negative. Actually systems are performing past expectations.
    The Daedalus will probably be running well past its projected shutdown date at
    this point. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Glad to hear DD, good job. I feel safe in your
    hands.\r\n\r\nDD:] As you should Doctor. I think I would rate my performance
    as one of the best Station DIs to ever be assigned. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: I didn't
    realize that DIs could be so vain lol.\r\n\r\nDD:/ It is not vanity if it is
    accurate Doctor. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Haha I suppose you are right. Sorry DD I
    was only teasing.\r\n\r\nDD;] So was I.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Very funny DD. What
    part of our orbit are we in? Anything of note?\r\n\r\nDD:| We will be passing
    close enough to Halley's Comet to get some good readings. Mendez will likely
    opt to launch a probe its way. \r\n\r\n1. [Continue]\r"
