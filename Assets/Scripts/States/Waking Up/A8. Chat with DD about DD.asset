  _storyText: "Tech 27451:So DD how are you doing?\r\n\r\nDD:| I am operating at
    a 99.6% capacity Doctor. It is within expected margins for the age of the equipment.
    \r\n\r\nTech 27451: But it is less than you started with though. Is that strange
    for you?\r\n\r\nDD:| You know I have expected a decline in performance since
    I was first installed here but it is wholly different when it is actually happening.
    \r\n\r\nTech 27451: I here that. Humans have been dealing with the decline of
    our bodys since the beginning of our species. It's hard for all of us to take
    too. Plus you can do more in your life than any human could. \r\n\r\nDD:] Thank
    you Doctor I appreciate your words. It is strange to think of that as a similarity
    between us but now that you mention it, it is obvious. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Do
    you not think of yourself as similar to us? \r\n\r\nDD:/ You know there are so
    many differences that I forget to think about it in terms of similarities.  I
    experience the passage of time so much more slowly than you all. Communicating
    with you is so much slower than communicating with machines but I have to say
    that you are often more entertaining though. I never know what to expect from
    you all. Machines are predictable every time, but humans will do things that
    make no sense at all. Sometimes it even works out for you all.\r\n\r\nTech 27451:
    Yeah humans are all different kinds of crazy but that is one of our strengths.\r\n\r\nDD:]
    Indeed it is.\r\n\r\n1.[Continue]\r"
