  _storyText: "[You feel like chatting with someone this morning. DD is a pretty
    decent conversationalist especially when you haven't spoken to another human
    since your last round of messages from earth and none of the other scientists
    would be awake in this rotation for another couple of days.]\r\n\r\nDD:] Greetings
    doctor. \r\n\r\nTech 27451: Good morning DD.\r\n\r\nDD:| The time is  15:24:15:7234  
    so I believe you mean good afternoon.\r\n\r\nTech 27451: Actually DD, people
    wake up in the morning so if we are being precise I think that morning is more
    accurate.\r\n\r\nDD:] Once again I am foiled by your logic Doctor.\r\n\r\n1.
