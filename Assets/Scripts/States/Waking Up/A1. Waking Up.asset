  _storyText: "[Your vision begins to acclimate to your surroundings as you finish
    zipping up your jumpsuit. Waking up from cryosleep always leaves one lethargic
    but this time seemed to be particularly bad. Still you suppose it is better than
    waiting for experiment results the old fashion way. This is your third time waking
    from a year long cryo-cycle to check the results of several experiments you have
    been conducting as a research technician aboard the UESS Daedalus.\r\n\r\nYou
    notice the blinking lights on your terminal indicating new messages, most likely
    the results from the experiments you left running when you went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAlso
    next to your terminal you notice you left your personal coffee maker ready to
    accept water and a few bland snack bars that won't disagree with your stomach
    after the effects of cryo.]\r\n\r\nHow will you proceed?\r\n\r\n1. [Make coffee
    and snack before you rejoin the real world]\r\n\r\n2. [Check your experiment
    results now]\r"
